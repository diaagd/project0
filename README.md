# Project 0

Hello Everyone,
In this first project, I would like to introduce myself to you through html content pages as per the requirememt.
I created 5 html pages: Welcome/WhoAmI/Education/Experience/Hobbies, where you can get from any page on your website to any other page by using a button toolbar including a class called "btn-group" and every button associated with an "a href" link, and every page is associated with bootstrap 4.4.1. and styles.css file, and all pages contain a mobile-responsive @media query for small color changing on screen size change.

I will start talking about the "Welcome" page, where you have 4 button-like links that redirect you to each corresponding page. In the top of the body, I used an id selector to introduce my name. Then you will find a table form for 4 a href links designated in a table and division with a special styling.

On the second page which is "WhoAmI", I used both ordered and unordered lists in a table division to introduce myself briefly with calling a variables.css.

On the third page which is "Education", I created a table with 3 columns and 4 rows, showing my educational background. Titles call for their font color from "nesting.css" and the short sentence wtitten below the table is in a paragraph also derives its style from "nesting.css". Note that the latter was written as .scss and then converted into .css using this online converter: *https://jsonformatter.org/scss-to-css"

On the fourth page called "Experience", a table with ordered list for my recent experiences is created on the top of the body, and a container is then established with 3 columns using bootstrap grid's model.

On the fifth page called "Hobbies", I inserted 3 images in a container showing my favourite hobbies, and in the bottom I gave a  brief description to each hobby each in a division and associated to class inherited from "inheritence.css" (ofcourse after converting this file from scss using same tool mentioned above).

Finally, and to whom it will concern, I hope this humble project finds you well.

Thank you.
Diaa
